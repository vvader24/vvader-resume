### Research statement

I am currently a PhD student in Personality Psychology at University of Oregon. The theoretical premise for my research is that the study of _Culture_ underlies the study of _Personality_ and _Values_. I am interested in using machine learning techniques to build psychological mappings of people across societies and design a quantifiable model of culture. Psychometrics, building culture specific ( _emic_ ) surveys, and applying quantitative methods to design methods for psychological data sets.
